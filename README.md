# ArduinoLibraries

This is only a gathering into a single git repository of all my home-made arduino libraries.

## installation

Simply clone this repository onto your `<Arduino Sketchbook Location>/libraries` and the libraries should became 
available.

## building

You can directly use the Arduino IDE, or any IDE that is able to work with CMake.

A `cmake` directory is bundled in this repository, this is a clone of 
[this one](https://github.com/a9183756-gh/Arduino-CMake-Toolchain).
